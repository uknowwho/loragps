# loragps
A script to convert the payload of the LW001-BG Lorawan-Based GPS tracker into GPS-coordinates. 

# Usage
I've intentionally kept it simple and copy-pastable so that people who have no programming experience can use it. Go to the file payload2gps.js and copy the code. Paste this in the payloaddecoder of your device. For a more detailed example see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT2FnwCoP7w
